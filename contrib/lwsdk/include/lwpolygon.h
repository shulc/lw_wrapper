 * This header defines the polygon handler.  A polygon type is defined by
 * one of these structures.  The struct contains its four-character type
 * code, some flags, and a private data pointer to be used by the polygon
 * type implementation, plus a set of callback functions used to implement
 * the generic behaviors of this type of polygon.
